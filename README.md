# OpenGLRawgenBase

OpenGLRawgenBase contains several parts of the OpenGLRaw [generator](https://github.com/Laar/OpenGLRawgen) that are useful without having the full generator. The packages it contains are:

* OpenGLRawgenBase: Basic types for the generator and possibly other packages dealing with it.
* OpenGLRawInterface: The machinereadable (xml) interface for the output of the generator. Useful for other packages that depend on the contents of OpenGLRaw.
